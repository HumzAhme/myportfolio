**Abstract**

As mobile communication becomes increasingly integral to daily life, smishing—phishing via SMS—poses a growing threat to user security. This study proposes a novel detection framework that leverages the advanced language understanding capabilities of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) combined with deep learning architectures. By fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model, our approach captures the nuanced linguistic features inherent in SMS text, enabling effective discrimination between legitimate messages and smishing attempts. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our hybrid model significantly outperforms traditional machine learning techniques in terms of precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. The results highlight the promise of integrating state-of-the-art deep learning models for robust, real-time smishing detection, ultimately contributing to enhanced mobile security and user protection.
