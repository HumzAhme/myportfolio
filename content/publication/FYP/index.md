**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art artificial intelligence to perform sentiment and emotion analysis on multimedia content. The proposed system integrates advanced natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to extract, process, and interpret data from diverse media sources. By combining transformer-based models for sentiment classification with emotion detection algorithms, the framework produces detailed affective profiles that capture both the polarity and intensity of emotions present in the content. In addition, the system employs robust OCR and face detection modules to process audio–visual inputs, while an automated pipeline facilitates real-time analysis and interactive visual analytics. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only achieves high accuracy in affective classification but also provides meaningful insights into content dynamics and viewer engagement. The scalability and adaptability of the framework make it applicable across various domains, including media monitoring, market research, and social media analytics. Overall, this research contributes to the field of affective computing by offering a comprehensive, multimodal solution for deep emotional analysis of multimedia data.
