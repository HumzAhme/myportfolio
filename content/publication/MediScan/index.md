**Abstract**

MediScan introduces an innovative, AI-powered framework that combines the strengths of RCNN-based image processing with advanced natural language processing to transform the digitization and analysis of medical receipts. By leveraging a custom RCNN architecture, the system precisely identifies and segments critical areas of receipt images—such as provider details, service descriptions, and billing amounts—even under diverse image conditions. Following segmentation, tailored NLP algorithms extract and standardize textual data, effectively correcting OCR inaccuracies and normalizing terminologies. This integrated approach not only facilitates automated data entry and error reduction but also supports sophisticated analytical tasks including expense categorization and trend monitoring. Evaluations on a varied dataset of medical receipts demonstrate that MediScan achieves high accuracy in both visual and textual processing, making it a promising solution for streamlining healthcare administrative workflows.
